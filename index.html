                    <h1>What does it look like?</h1>
                    <p>The northern Quoll has a reddish brown coloured fur with a under bellow as a cream colour. It has white spots on its back and rump with its tail unspotted, with a pointed snout. The northern Quoll is a carnivore and can weigh up to 1.2 kg. The male is normally bigger in size compared to the female. Although they are marsupials, female northern quolls do not have a pouch. At the start of the breeding season the skin around the nipples becomes enlarged and partially surrounded by a pouch like skin partially covering the nipples.</p>

                    <h1>Why is it endangerd?</h1>
                    <p>One main reason on why the Northern Quoll is endangered is it's predators. They are constantly being attacked by feral cats. They can also be killed by eating cane toads, due to their poison. This effect is backed up upon by bushfires, that are burning groundcover and reducing their habitats. Because of these reasons there is approximately 100,000 left in the wild.</p>

                    <h1>What is it's Ecological Niche?</h1>

                    <p>The Northern Quoll normally lie in rocky slops and open eucalyptus forests. 
                        Lives in three holes or occasionally termite mounds.
                        In savanna landscapes, females maintain a territory of about 35 hectares while males have 150 hectares. 
                        Rocky areas are considered to be prime habitats for Northern Quoll.
                        The Northern Quoll occupies a diverse range of habitats including rocky areas, eucalypt forests, woodlands, rainforests, sandy lowlands, beaches, shrublands, grass and desert. 
                        Rocky areas are identified in the National Recovery Plan for the Northern Quoll (Hill and Ward 2010) as habitat critical to the survival of the species as they are often used as denning and refuge sites.
