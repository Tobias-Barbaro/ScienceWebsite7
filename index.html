                    <h1>What does it look like?</h1>
                    <p>The northern Quoll has a reddish brown coloured fur with a under bellow as a cream colour. It has white spots on its back and rump with its tail unspotted, with a pointed snout. The northern Quoll is a carnivore and can weigh up to 1.2 kg. The male is normally bigger in size compared to the female. Although they are marsupials, female northern quolls do not have a pouch. At the start of the breeding season the skin around the nipples becomes enlarged and partially surrounded by a pouch like skin partially covering the nipples.</p>

                    <h1>Why is it endangerd?</h1>
                    <p>One main reason on why the Northern Quoll is endangered is it's predators. They are constantly being attacked by feral cats. They can also be killed by eating cane toads, due to their poison. This effect is backed up upon by bushfires, that are burning groundcover and reducing their habitats. Because of these reasons there is approximately 100,000 left in the wild.</p>
