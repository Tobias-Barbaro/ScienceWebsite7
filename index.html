                    <h1>Why is it endangerd?</h1>
                    <p>One main reason on why the Northern Quoll is endangered is it's predators. They are constantly being attacked by feral cats, and cane toads, that can easily poison and kill them. This effect is backed up upon by bushfires, that are burning groundcover and reducing their habitats. Because of these reasons there is approximately 100,000 left in the wild.
